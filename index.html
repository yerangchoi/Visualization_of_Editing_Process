			    worse. 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">

			<!-- (———) -->I got an internship in the city, through the New York Times, doing children's journalism illustration. At that point, my life completely changed. I was new to the city, and I didn't realize there were so many homeless people. That made being homeless seem like the thing. It was weird. And I hit rock bottom. I had no self esteem. I had a lot of insecurities, no self-esteem, a lot of inner conflicts that were undealt with. At that time I was coming from a gang life, a homophobic life, 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">Um, well,</b>

			had an optimistic viewpoint of things. And that's due to the fact that my grandmother, may she rest in peace, kept me in church my entire life. 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">Um, so,</b>

				<b>That's</b>

			 because of the things I've seen. That's one of the things that kept me motivated to stay in school.

			<br>
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			<!-- (———) -->I was homeless, and I didn't know anything else. So, when I graduated high school, I went straight into

				</span>

			 foster care did take care of the funds, as far as that is concerned, so that was part of the push as well, But that's what kept me motivated. My mom,—my moms...—the plethora of mom's that I've had, you know, it was very much, “You're not gonna be shit,” the whole, the normal nonsense that kids in foster care endure. And those were the things that kept me motivated

				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">I hear people,</b>
				<b>You</b>
				</span>
			  hear the people who are ignorant and oblivious that homelessness can happen to them, in the blink of an eye, and then you also have the people who you know, motivate you to not to give up., because There's so much out there if you want it. If you sit around and expect stuff to come to you, then maybe you're gonna end up like that. Or, you can just put yourself out there better.
			<br>
			<br>
			<!-- (———) -->I slept in Central Park for 6 months,. I slept in subways,. and Even then, I was working two part-time jobs,. I was going to school, and every day I'd buy a new pair of socks, a new pair of boxers, I'd go take bird baths inside Port Authority or Penn Station. I'd meet people who were receptive to my spirit, and would allow me to utilize their space—you know, if I wanted to eat, if I wanted to rest, if I wanted to change my clothes, whatever it may be. That's what kept me going.
			<br>
			<br>
			Interviewer:
			<br>
			 Was it challenging to be homeless but not have people around you realize that?
 


		<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">It was um...</b>
				<b>Um...</b>
				</span> 			
			… It was 
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">really challenging, and</b>
			<b>challenging. And</b>
			</span> 
			the difficult part was, when I got tired of sleeping on the street, I was directed toward homeless youth shelters. I didn't know what 
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">those things were.</b>
			<b>they were.</b>
			</span> 

			I was really ignorant 

			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">towards</b>
			<b>of</b>
			</span> 

			the LGBT community. I didn't know anything. So when I would converse with people, socializing, or trying to network
			
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">,</b>
			<b>-</b>
			</span> 

			putting my resume out there
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">,</b>
			<b>-</b>
			</span> 
			 I'd say, “I'm homeless.” I think that's an important factor to a certain extent. And 
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">they'd</b>
			<b>people would</b>
			</span> 
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			look at me like I had seven heads
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">, like “no way.” You </b>
			<b>. "But you</b>

			 have on clean

			</span> 
			<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
			<b class="is-visible">your hair is… you know, I</b>
			<b>I</b>
			</span> 

			
			 feel like I helped a lot of people understand the tone, you can't judge a book by its cover type thing, because when you're on the train, the person next to you, that could be the where they sleep, and you wouldn't know it just by looking at them.
			<br>
			<br>
			—So being homeless, and not looking homeless, whatever that means, and being directed towards a homeless youth shelter, I'm coming as a heterosexual man. And I was told about the covenant house. I went there, there was no male beds. So, it was like, “Okay, it's back to Central Park I go." And then this random person I was talking to in Starbucks,—you know, where 42nd Street is?
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">

				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">And</b>
				<b>-and</b>
				</span> 		

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				he was like, “you should check out Sylvia's Place.” And the way he was making it sound, it was like a Five Star Hotel, free. You know, they help homeless youth, you know, so cool. I 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">go</b>
				<b>went</b>
				</span>
		
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				in and I didn't know what was going on. It was a whole different atmosphere for me. I mean, the fact that it's a church and there's a big rainbow flag outside 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">the church.</b>
				<b>it.</b>
				</span>
			<br>
			<br>
			————So anyway, when I went in there it was like, first question they asked me was how did I identify? I didn't even know what the hell that meant. So, I looked dumbfounded. 
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			They were like, “Are you gay, are you straight? Bi?” So,

				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">So again,</b>
				<b>—Again,</b>
				</span>

			I’m coming from a gang-related, homophobic background, I'm like "why would you ask me that? What kinda freak do I look like?' They were like, “You can't stay here.” And that hit me so hard. But what hit me harder was when I got back outside and it was cold. So at that point I had to make a life decision. I walked up a block, came back. I had to swallow my pride as a man and to deal with things. Within experiencing that, I've actually become such an advocate for the LGBT community. I've done rallies, I've done protests, before marriage was approved, I've sat on LGBT panels to speak about the problems within the community and how it can help,—inside the community, so that we can solve problems outside the community. I started like a little group, for heterosexuals to get together and mingle with LGBT community people and realize that no one's different. You know, I was really in it.

			<br>
			<br>

			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			———The only thing about that was that I got really comfortable with being homeless. Really comfortable. What came to me,—one of the first people I met,—was Miss Kate. And from day one, she saw my potential. I will always love that lady. Anything she asks, I will give it to her. I will never forget her. And I got really comfortable. I'm like, 'I'm gonna get out of here in a month.' I had a decent income. What was supposed to be a month turned into a year, turned into two years. I'm just like, wowww...,, this is craaazy.... And even in that, you have people who will meet you where you're at in life. You have people who try to bring you back to where they're at. Then you have to deal with that. Then, with me, it was a little different, a little difficult. You had to deal with trying to deal with trying to help other people understand what it's like "oh, why you hanging out with them faggots?" And I'm like, "really though?" Now my whole mentality is different. People who knew me before, it was all like, “let's go fight, let's go hang out with these girls.” And 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">And so</b>
				<b>—So</b>
				</span>
			now, you see Nate, and his clothes fit him. He'd much rather go hang out at the pier than to go hang out with a bunch of little girls, or a bunch of  dudes, who all they want to do is  smoke, drink, and start fights. You know what I'm saying? It was different for me. It was complicated. But within that, it taught me how to love myself, how to accept myself, how to be comfortable with myself, and it helped me understand how powerful society is. And how it affects people. If you were born where it was okay for two men to walk down the street, if it was okay for men who felt that they were a female trapped in a man's body to live that life, 
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
			then no one would… 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">It</b>
				<b>it</b>
				</span>

			wouldn't be an issue. Even with church.
			<br>
			<br>
			(———)I never  took church seriously. I love church because I'm a musician. That's what kept me in church. That and the fact that women 80 and 90 curse everyone out at church. And that kept me there. But, you know, when they preach about homophobia, you know, everyone has their interpretation of the bible. 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				But I just found it difficult. One day I was asked to speak in the church.
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">This</b>
				<b>—this</b>
				</span>
				this is a Baptist Church,—you can't come in there if you're gay. It just won't work. Everyone wants to pray over you, 

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				you're the devil's child, you know, 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">this</b>
				<b>—This</b>
				</span>
			is a Baptist church. So I was asked to speak, because I was part of a poet's society. When I spoke, I spoke about LGBT issues. I spoke about the real abomination: behind it. And how we, as Christian folks, believers in god, as humans, and we're hypocrites if we say “god is love, god is for everyone, god don't judge.” We go out there and we judge, and we ridicule, and we criticize, you know what I'm saying? It just wasn't cool.

			<br>
			<br>
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				(———)I think that my homeless experience was the best experience for me now. So to this day, 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">now</b>
				<b>—Now</b>
				</span>
			I'm a senior at Hunter. Hopefully this May, lord willing, I'll be getting my 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">bachelors</b>
				<b>—B.A.</b>
			</span>
			I have my own apartment in the Lower East Side., Manhattan, I still don't drink, don't smoke, no kids, I'm healthy, and I never act brand new. I never act brand new. I never forget where I come from. I still go to Sylvia's, Ali Forney Center, Streetwalks, The Door. I still go back. I go to tell people thank you. If there's an event, I always show my face, show respect, because if it hadn't been for y’all, where would I be? I didn't come in with so much maturity, so much understanding, I didn't come in like that. I came in with a lot of problems. I used to self mutilate, I loved attention, I was always, like, kinda passive at times. I wasn't consistent with my medication at times. There were a lot of things, and there were very few people. Miss Kate is always one of those people that just was never two faced, never different. Even in my low, when I was really down, she was always one of those people who was like “one day, when you're ready.” She kept it real. I'm not one for the “oh, you poor thing,” treatment. ‘Cause then I'm just gonna feel like hey, 


				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				it's not my fault., then everything is fine. And 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">miss kate</b>
				<b>—Miss Kate</b>
				</span>
			is gentle, kind, and she knows how to treat people individually, and people as a whole at the same time. And I love that about her. Yeah, my experience was incredible.

			<br>
			<br>

			(———)Anyway, I joined activist groups...and even though marriage was approved, there's still problems. People made this thing, like, “once marriage is approved, things will…” No. It's not like that. To this day, there's still so much conflict, so 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">much</b>
				<b>many</b>
				</span>

			problems within the community itself.

			<br>
			<br>
			Interviewer:
			<br>
			 Problems within the community itself, and the LGBT community's response to homeless youth?

			<br>
			<br>
			Nate:
			<br>
			 The conflicts within the community is that there are so 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">much</b>
				<b>many</b>
				</span>
			inner conflicts, insecurities, low self-esteem, um, suppressed problems that have not been dealt with or people have refused to deal with, and causes them to combat with one another, to butt heads, and causes so much friction and rebellion towards each other. And the problem doesn't lie with each other. Like, a gay man, compared to a transgender person. or transexual. 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
					Trans
				<b class="is-visible">exual,</b>
				<b>gender people,</b>
				</span>

			their life and their struggles within the community are a lot more severe than just someone 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">being a</b>
				<b>—who is</b>
				</span>
				lesbian or gay. 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				A gay man and a bisexual man?, 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">there's</b>
				<b>There's</b>
				</span>
			 
			<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				conflict there. Because this person feels like you can't have both, you have to know what you want. So
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">So there's</b>
				<b>—There's</b>
				</span>

			so much judgement. There's not enough acceptance. And that's only because there's not enough acceptance 
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">in their</b>
				<b>—of themselves.</b>
				</span>
			

			 You can't possibly know what it’s like to understand somebody else and what their decisions are and how they choose to live their life, and what makes them happy.

			<br>
			<br>

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
					(———)And with the issue of LGBT homelessness being recognized now 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">incorporated, you think about, you know, like, </b>
				<b>—it makes you think about</b>
				</span>
				 how far homelessness and the LGBT community go back, and the pier, and that whole scene. You know, like,It's just difficult. I wouldn't know what to do, ‘cause, you know, 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">being</b>
				<b>—Being</b>
				</span>

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">

				homeless and being LGBT, in that category, in that box, is difficult. Because 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">Because now</b>
				<b>—Now</b>
				</span>


			you gotta deal with the majority of society not accepting you. Then being homeless. And you're homeless and you're 

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">youthful.</b>
				<b>—young.</b>
				</span>

			 So your family told you, “we don't want you, we don't love you, because we can't accept you being you.” That's some hard shit to deal with. Who could walks around with that on their shoulders and be happy? So then you got some guy to come around who offers you five hundred dollars to make him happy, five hundred dollars to you, hell, even eighty dollars 

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">to you, being</b>
				<b>—and you’re</b>
				</span>
			on the street, praying that your next meal comes soon, praying that you find somewhere warm to stay. It seems like the best thing coming. So, thinking about an STD or HIV, or being killed, none of that stuff matters. None of it matters.

			<br>
			<br>

			(———)And then you get the ones who get their little cliques, and they get somewhere to stay. At a friends house. So then they think they're better than you. Not really understanding you're still homeless, you're still in the same predicament I'm in, trying to find stability. We haven't got there yet. So instead of holding one another up to gain that stability, it's, you know, so much shade, and just like, hypocrisy. It's bad. And I feel like nothing's gonna change. There's not enough people focusing on the real problems. People are still focusing on superficial shit like marriage.

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">

				
			(———)This city to me? There are so many opportunities in this city. I don't feel like now 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">there's an excuse. Of what your sexual preference is.</b>
				<b>your sexual preference is an excuse.</b>
				</span>
			I don't feel there's an excuse for anything. For all the problems going on in the community. There's so much ignorance. There's no excuse.

			<br>
			<br>
			Interviewer:
			<br>
			 And what do you think the problems are? Is it family not accepting their children? Lack of support? Lack of funding from the government?
			<br>
			<br>
			Nate:
			<br>
			 I personally think that there's always a root. I feel like it starts at home. I feel like if your child comes home, and your child has to be afraid to live their life in front of you, that's a problem. You carried this person for nine months. Why is this person having to live a life in front of you, but then when they go out and go to school they're scared to be seen?
			<br>
			<br>
			
				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">

			homeless and being LGBT, in that category, in that box, is difficult. Because 
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">i</b>
				<b>I</b>
				</span>

			 've seen kids on the pier at like 9 and 12 who say “my Mom kicked me out ‘cause I'm gay.”And I'm like “what? Your Mom kicked you out ‘cause... what?!” So you're not going to school. We can't do nothing about that. We can't go in homes and beat parents up, so 
			 	<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">that</b>
				<b>it</b>
				</span>
			 falls back on the government. So. When we know there's a problem, we find a solution. It's hard,. 

				<h1 class="cd-headline letters type">
				<span class="cd-words-wrapper waiting">
				<b class="is-visible">the</b>
				<b>The</b>
				</span>
			the government is hard to deal with. difficult, you know what I'm saying? Even though there are famous leaders in life who are LGBT related. I mean,

			favorite one was Bayard Ruston, the man behind Martin Luther King. The man was openly gay, like, I had a dinner date with his husband. His husband is still alive. I won it. It's not like we’re friends or anything, but... I won it. It was amazing.
			
			<br>
			<br>	
			(———)So why is it that the government is not like “these are children.” Not, “these are gay people,” or these are “different” people, “alternative lifestyle” people. These are people. These are kids… on the street! I wish I had the opportunity to get into the government. Not to “get into” it, but kinda, like, sit in front of a panel. I feel like if they heard me, my message is I feel like I have a message powerful enough. I feel like my story is different. We
